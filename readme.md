# Axe Throwing Project

Welcome to the repo housing Dakota Turk's Final project of EE465 Computer Graphics. This take on this project was a modular 3D environment system that would allow for the ability to interact and build the project as if one were designing a game in a 3D engine. The inspirations for this are from 3D game engines such as [Unity](https://unity.com) or [Godot](https://godotengine.org). Included in this report will be things that were both mandatory to implement and not. At the end of this report will be a summary of the mandatory implementations.

## The "Axe throwing simulator"

While this isn't a very high performant or very accurate simulation of throwing an axe. The idea of this project was to have fun implementing new things while still allowing for a semi-fun experience for the user when playing this. The idea of this is simply to have some axes near the player than can be picked up and thrown across room. There is also a dice that can be "rolled" near these axes.
